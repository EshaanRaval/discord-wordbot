## Purpose, Achievements, and Goals

### Purpose:
WordBot was created to build an engaging and educational environment within the Discord community, focusing on vocabulary, language learning, and fun word-based games. The bot enhances users' linguistic skills through various interactive commands and activities.

### Achievements:
We have successfully developed a comprehensive set of commands for WordBot, each serving a unique function to cater to the diverse needs of our community:

1. **Define**: Provides definitions for words, aiding in vocabulary expansion and understanding.
2. **Define with Examples**: Offers definitions along with example sentences, helping users understand the context and usage of words.
3. **Define with Synonyms**: Gives definitions and synonyms, enriching users' word choices and enhancing their descriptive abilities.
4. **Origin (Etymology)**: Reveals the origins and historical development of words, providing fascinating insights into language evolution.
5. **Quote**: Shares inspiring or thought-provoking quotes, promoting reflection and discussion within the community.
6. **Word-Chain**: A game where players create a chain of words, each starting with the last letter of the previous word, encouraging quick thinking and creativity.
7. **One-Word Story**: A collaborative storytelling game where each player contributes a single word, fostering creativity and teamwork.
8. **Count**: A counting game to see how high members can count in sequence without mistakes, promoting attention and group coordination.
9. **Boom**: A number game where players must avoid saying certain numbers, adding an element of strategy and fun.
10. **Hangman**: A classic word-guessing game with single-player and multiplayer modes, themed around a medieval trial, offering both educational value and entertainment.

### Goals:
The goals we aimed to accomplish with WordBot include:

1. **Educational Engagement**: By providing definitions, synonyms, etymology, and example sentences, WordBot helps users improve their vocabulary and understanding of the English language interactively.
2. **Interactive Learning**: Through games like Word-Chain, One-Word Story, and Hangman, we aim to make learning fun and engaging, encouraging users to think creatively and collaboratively.
3. **Community Building**: WordBot's multiplayer games and quote-sharing features foster a sense of community, promoting interaction and bonding among members.
4. **Mental Agility**: Games like Count and Boom challenge users' mental agility and strategic thinking, contributing to cognitive development.
5. **Inspiration and Reflection**: The Quote command aims to inspire and provoke thought, adding a layer of intellectual engagement to the community.

## Creation Journey

I enrolled in CS 114 at the University of Waterloo during Fall 2023, where I learned basic computing principles and Python. Drawing from this knowledge, a friend suggested creating a Discord bot for their server, "Calm Universe." They also proposed resurrecting a discontinued bot called WordBot ([WordBot](https://top.gg/bot/708327119851356251)).

I decided to develop a chat-based word game (Word-Chain) for the server members. Fun fact: I completed the word-based game on October 24, 2023 (definitely not during midterms), and later added more features in January and July 2024 to enhance engagement and informativeness. This project marked my debut in coding and programming, sparking my interest in exploring more with this newfound knowledge. Hint: I'm considering integrating something related to Spotify next.

## What I Learned:

- **Discord Bot Development**: Bot creation, command handling, and API integration.
- **Version Control with Git & GitHub**: Repository management, branching, merging, and collaboration.
- **Python Programming**: Syntax, language features, and gaining proficiency.
- **API Usage & Integration**: Leveraging Discord API and others (e.g., retrieving quotes, word definitions).
  - Credits to APIs used: Quote ([Quotable API](https://api.quotable.io/)), Word Games & Definitions ([Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev)), Word Synonyms & Examples (web scraping, [WordHippo](https://www.wordhippo.com)), Etymology ([Etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com)), Hangman Game ([Random Word API](https://random-word-api.vercel.app)).
- **Database Management**: Handling data storage and management.
- **Problem Solving & Debugging**: Troubleshooting and resolving issues.
- **Project Management**: Planning, feature implementation, and task organization.
- **Learning & Adaptability**: Iterating based on feedback to enhance functionality and user engagement.

Special thanks to my friends, Cameron Morland (CS 114 Professor), Rapptz (Creator of discord.py) and the creators of the APIs used. Additional gratitude goes to the original authors of WordBot: nephthy, ysfchn, and Zamion101.

A quote from Prof. Morland that resonated with me: 
> "Start by working with an existing project, and work to understand a piece of it well enough to modify its behavior. Gradually change something that works. Break it, then fix it; add new capabilities, or make them work differently."
